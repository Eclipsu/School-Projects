#### In programming, a loop is used to repeat a block of code until the specified condition is met.

#### C programming has three types of loops:

- for loop
- while loop
- do...while loop

## For loop:

The syntax of the for loop is:

```c
for (initializationStatement; testExpression; updateStatement)
{
    // statements inside the body of loop
}
```

---

# How 'for loop' works?

1. The initialization statement is executed only once.
2. Then, the test expression is evaluated. If the test expression is evaluated to false, the for loop is terminated.
3. However, if the test expression is evaluated to true, statements inside the body of the for loop are executed, and the update expression is updated.

4. Again the test expression is evaluated.

**This process goes on until the test expression is false. When the test expression is false, the loop terminates.**
